> During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day

> In the autumn of that year

> When the clouds hung oppressively low in heaven

> I had been passing alone on the horse'back

> Through the singularly, dreary tract of country

> And at length found myself

> as the shades of the evening drew on

> Within view of the melancholy House of Usher

> I know not how it was

> But with the first glimpse of the building

> A sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit

> I looked upon some blank scape for domain

> Upon the bleak walls, upon the white trunks of decayed trees

> With the utter depression souls

> There was an iceness

> A sinking

> A sickening of the heart
